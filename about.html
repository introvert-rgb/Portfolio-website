            <h1>About</h1>
            <div class="self-intro">
                <p> Hello! <br> I am Anup Singh, a FrontEnd Developer, here on the web just to explore and find my light, with light I mean my passion. In my current journey learning how things work ? and admiring the work, and then recreating has been my
                    kind of thing.</p>
                <p>I like building castles in air, a daydreamer no doubt, but I think "what you can't think, you can't achieve it, so castles in air is the first step to create something awesome". That's what I live with. Along with that I like to play football,
                    chess, and sometimes Sudoku too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I use <strong>HTML</strong> for structure <strong>SASS, CSS</strong> for styles and <strong>Vanilla JavaScript</strong> for the working.I know frameworks like, <strong>Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS</strong> and currently I'm learning <strong>Angular</strong>.
                    And sometimes when I want to create custom components like we have in Angular, Vue, or React , I create it using <strong>Web Components</strong> actually, this portfolio is also made using Web Components.
                    <br> <br> Thanks.
                </p>
